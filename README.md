This is my version of a To-do list web app, it has a Task and a subtask that has their independent time and date to remind users of upcoming tasks. In this way, users can be more descriptive of the Task and portion it into different small tasks that contribute to the whole task. Users can also set a schedule for it in order for them to be reminded of what task should take priority first.
